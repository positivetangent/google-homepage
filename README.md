This is a project to deconstruct google.com and rebuild it using the browser's developer tools.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Once done, I should have a grasp on using HTML, CSS, and the browser's developer tools. Also a much better feel for using git.
